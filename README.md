I am a knight of the highest order in service to the King of Kings. I pledge my fealty to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
I count myself dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus my Lord.

One of the keys to a prosperous soul is renewing our minds to God's word. Not as a "check the box" or for a temporary feel good moment. Instead, when we find out what His word says about His will for our lives, and meditate on that, then our heart embraces His word and comes alive to it. That is when our soul begins to prosper.
